# Lifecycle and errors
Here we'll learn about the different statuses a payment can transition
into after it has been created, as well as learn of possible errors
that may result in a payment's failure and how Method handles them.

---
### Lifecycle
Once a payment has been created, it will initially have the `pending` status. This indicates that the payment
has not yet been processed, and is still allowed to be `canceled`.

:::caution
Only payments in the `pending` status can be `canceled`.
:::

If the payment is created __before__ the current business day's [cutoff time](/api/core/payments/object#cutoff-time)
(Monday - Friday 2:30 PM CST), it will be processed and transition into the `sent` status. If it is
created __after__ the current business day's cutoff time, the payment will be sent on the next business day.

If the payment was successful, the transferred funds should be reflected on the destination account
in the next morning. However, for the purpose of security, most financial institutions have varying holding
periods which may cause the funds to reflect at a later date.

ℹ️ See [the payment statuses](/api/core/payments/object#payment-statuses) for details on payment statuses.

---

### Errors
When a payment fails, its status transitions from `sent` to
either `returned`, `reversed`, or `reversal_required`.

#### Returned payments
When a payment's status transitions from `sent` to `returned`, this indicates that the
retrieval of funds from the source account failed __before__ the funds reached the destination account.
This can occur as a result of the following:
- The source account does not have sufficient funds for the amount of the payment.
- The holder of the source account revoked authorization with their bank to prevent Method from pulling
the funds.
- The source account had invalid account information.
- The source account has been closed.

#### Payment reversals
For payments that transition into the `reversal_required` status, this indicates that
the retrieval of funds from the source account failed __after__ the funds reached the
destination account. In this case, Method will do either of the following:

- Automatically reverse the incorrectly transferred funds from the destination account.
- Manually reverse the incorrectly transferred funds from the destination account within
60 days of the occurrence.

Once the payment reversal has been resolved, the payment's status will transition into `reversed`.

### Setting up webhooks for lifecycle transitions
To automatically get notified once a payment transitions into a specific status,
you can set up a webhook that sends information regarding each transition.

ℹ️ See [the webhook object](/api/core/webhooks/object) for details on the API.
