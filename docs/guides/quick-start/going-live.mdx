# Going live

In the previous topic, we were able to successfully create a
payment from the ACH and liability account we connected
through the Method API.

Because this guide was completed in the `development` environment with sample data,
verification for the ACH account was turned off for simplicity.

In the `sandbox` or `production` environments, source accounts will
require an additional step for verification.

ℹ️ See [ACH verification](/guides/accounts/ach-verification) to learn more.
