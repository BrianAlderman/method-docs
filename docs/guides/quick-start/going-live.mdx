# Going live

In the previous topic, we were able to successfully create a
payment from the source and destination accounts we connected
through the Method API.

Because this guide was completed in the `development` environment with sample data,
verification for soruce accounts was turned off for simplicity.

In the `sandbox` or `production` environments, source accounts will
require an additional step for verification.

ℹ️ See [verification and capabilities](/guides/source-accounts/verification-and-capabilities) under
the [source accounts](/guides/source-accounts) section to learn more.
