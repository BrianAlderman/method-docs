# Going live

In the previous document, we were able to successfully create a
payment from the source and destination accounts we connected
through the Method API.

Because this guide was completed in the `development` environment with sample data,
verification for accounts were turned off for simplicity.

In the `sandbox` or `production` environments, source accounts will
require an additional step for verification. This can be done through any of
the following:

# TODO[mdelcarmen]: link these
- [__Micro-deposits__](#) - Initiating and confirming micro-deposits amounts.
- [__Plaid__](#) - Providing raw balances and transaction data from Plaid.
- [__MX__](#) - Providing raw account and transaction data from MX.
