# Create a destination account

A destination account is an account to which payment funds will be
sent. In the Method ecosystem, this account can either be an ACH account
or a Liability account.

ℹ️ See [the account object](/api/core/accounts/object) for details on the API.

### Liability accounts
Liability accounts are accounts that hold a type of debt or balance owed to a financial institution, and can
only be used to receive payments. When [creating a liability account](/guides/destination-accounts/liabilities), verification is done immediately
by checking that a valid account number exists within a specific financial institution. In the Method ecosystem
these financial institutions are referred to as [merchants](/api/core/merchants/object). Therefore,
each liability account should be associated to a merchant.

#### Supported liability accounts:

- Credit Cards
- Auto Loan
- Business Loan
- Personal Loans
- Home Equity Loan
- Home Loan / Mortgage
- Generic Loans
- Insurance Bills
- Internet Bills
- Student Loans
- Electric Bills
- Telephone Bills
- TV Bills
- Water Bills
- Waste / Garbage Bills

### ACH accounts / Bank accounts
Since ACH accounts can either send or receive funds, they can function as either source or destination accounts.
Unlike the verification required for an ACH account to send funds, minimal verification is required to enable
an ACH account's capability to received funds.

➡️ See [create a destination account](/guides/destination-accounts/bank-accounts) with
bank account information.
