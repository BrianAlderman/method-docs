# Bank accounts
Like the creation of source accounts, creating a destination account
with [ACH information](/guides/source-accounts/create-a-source-account#ach-accounts)
is done in the same manner without the need for the additional verification step. The account
simply needs to have the `payments:receive` capability.

ℹ️ Refer to [this request](/guides/source-accounts/create-a-source-account#request) to
create this type of destination account.
