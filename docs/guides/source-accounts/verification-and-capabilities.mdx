# Verification and capabilities

Source accounts require verification before they can be used to
create payments. Moreover, when source accounts are created,
they are given the `payments:receive` capability which enables the account
to receive payments. Verification gives source accounts the `payments:send`
capability which enables the account to send payments.

:::info
In the `development` environment, accounts are automatically verified
and already have the capability to both send and receive payments.
:::

:::tip
If you are a __Neobank__ that offers checking accounts or savings accounts, verification
can be bypassed for provisioned accounts. Please email us at team@methodfi.com for
more information.

### Micro-deposits verification
After a source account has been created, you can start the verification process by
[initiating micro-deposits verification](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/create-micro-deposits).
Next, Method will deposit two small amounts (between $0.01 and $0.30) into the account
and should be received within 1 - 3 business days.

Once the amounts have been received, the owner of the account
must [confirm the amounts](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/update)
that were deposited.

### Plaid verification
Source accounts that have been created by retrieving routing
and account number information from Plaid can be verified
by [creating a Plaid verification](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/create-plaid) with
raw [balance](https://plaid.com/docs/balance/#balance-data) and
[transaction](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/#overview) data.

The Plaid verification process only takes a few seconds.

### MX verification
Source accounts that have been created by retrieving routing
and account number information from MX can be verified
by [creating an MX verification](/api/core/accounts/ach-verification/create-mx) with
raw [account](https://docs.mx.com/atrium#endpoints_accounts_read_account) and
[transaction](https://docs.mx.com/atrium#endpoints_accounts_list_account_transactions) data.

The MX verification process only takes a few seconds.
