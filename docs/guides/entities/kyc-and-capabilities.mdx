# KYC and capabilities

To prevent fraud, Method performs KYC / AML verification on your behalf. This verification
is automatically done and only requires basic information about an entity.

---

### Know Your Customer

Method performs a KYC process to verify the entity's identity upon creation.
Payments are only allowed between an entity's accounts once the verification
is completed. This is crucial in detecting fraud and remaining compliant with
banking regulations.

---

### Capabilities

Capabilities determine whether an entity can send or receive payments.
Providing basic entity information as it is collected or
upon creation enables these capabilities.

:::note
An entity's capabilities can be revoked due to payment failures. See
[payment errors and capabilities](/guides/payments/lifecycle-and-errors#errors-and-capabilities).
:::

ℹ️ See [entity capabilities](/api/core/entities/object#entity-capabilities)
for details on the API.

:::tip
Method allows you to create entities with minimal information, then update
that entity as you collect more information.
:::

As an entity is updated with more information, its capabilities are enabled. Once
the `payments:receive` capability on an entity has been enabled, the entity is
then transitioned from the `incomplete` status to the `active` status.

:::note
Once an entity's property has been set, that specific property can no longer be updated.
:::
