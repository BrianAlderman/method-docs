:::tip
Method allows you to create entities with minimal information, and update
that entity as you collect more information.

Entities will transition from the `incomplete` status to `active` as more information
is provided. The `active` status indicates that the entity has been verified and can
then send and receive payments.

Once an entity is `active` no additional information
is required, and further updating of the entity is not allowed.
