# Identity verification

With additional identity verification, you will be able to automatically retrieve
and link all of an individual entity's debts to Method. This additional verification
will require the entity to answer a set of security questions that will verify
their identity and ownership over those debts.

:::caution
Only entities with the `data:retrieve` capability available can continue
with this guide. Refer back to the [retrieve data capability](/guides/entities/capabilities#retrieve-data)
section if you wish to follow this guide.

### Create an auth session
The first step in verifying an entity's identity is creating an auth session.
This request returns a list of security questions that the entity must
correctly answer.

<EntitiesCreateIndividualAuthSession />

#### Response
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id" : "qtn_ywWqCnXDGGmmg",
      "text" : "What is the monthly payment of your most recent auto loan or lease?",
      "answers" : [
        {
          "id" : "ans_qHLLEUBVpSpTK",
          "text" : "$601 - $700"
        },
        {
          "id" : "ans_74H68MJjqNhk8",
          "text" : "None of the Above"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Update an auth session
Next we'll provide the answers to the security questions. This request
may either return a list of additional security questions, or a
`cxn_id` which indicates that the verification was successful.

<EntitiesUpdateIndividualAuthSession />

#### Response (Verification Successful)
Once we receive a non-null `cxn_id`, we have successfully verified this entity's
identity and retrieved their debt accounts.

```json
{
  "questions": [],
  "cxn_id": "cxn_iENwAPKnNqA5j"
}
```

#### Response (Additional Verification Required)
In some cases, you may need to go through an additional set of security questions to fully verify.
Simply repeat the request with answers for the new set of security questions.

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id" : "qtn_7smgfLrU6M5tt",
      "text" : "Which of the following is a current or previous employer?",
      "answers" : [
        {
          "id" : "ans_ZExAcSeGjgEwS",
          "text" : "Men's Wearhouse"
        },
        {
          "id" : "ans_8MRLxgtQxEmYV",
          "text" : "Target"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "cxn_id": null
}
```

### Retrieving the verified connection
The resulting resource created from verifying an entity's identity is
a connection object which contains the list of debt accounts retrieved
for this entity.

<ConnectionsRetrieve />

#### Response
```json
{
  "id": "cxn_iENwAPKnNqA5j",
  "entity_id": "ent_au22b1fbFJbp8",
  "accounts": [
    "acc_XaDZc8tE4YVeJ",
    "acc_k5NzziUDg7hTg",
    "acc_p3xR5ne3iAX6g",
    "acc_mDDi64jzWUgSx",
    "acc_EpcLnJSkSCnRM"
  ],
  "source": "method_data",
  "status": "success",
  "error": null,
  "created_at": "2022-02-16T18:02:21.866Z",
  "updated_at": "2022-02-20T22:50:45.391Z",
  "last_synced_at": "2022-02-20T22:50:45.391Z"
}
```
