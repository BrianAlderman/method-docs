# Overview of Method Link

Method link allows you to securely collect account numbers or PANs ("Primary account number") from your users. Method Link handles the tokenization, and creation of the account on your behalf.

### Link Environments
Link shares the same environments as the Method API. Link should be launched in the same environment that generated the `link_token`. ➡️ See [Method Environments](/docs/api/environments) for more info.

### Link Flow Overview
The Method link flow begins once your user is prompted to enter the account number for their `liability`. This usually occurs after a user connected their financial account using an aggregator such as Plaid.

#### 1. Create Link Token
Your backend server will make a request to `/link/token` to generate a `link_token` for an `entity`. This `link_token` will be used to initalize link in your app.

➡️ [Implementation Guide - Create Link Token](/docs/api/link/implementation/create-token)

#### 2. Initialize Link
Using the `link_token` to launch link for your user. Once the user successfully connects their financial account, link will return a temporary `public_account_token` to exchange and create an `account`.

➡️ [Implementation Guide - Initialize Link](/docs/api/link/implementation/launch-link)

#### 3. Exchange Public Account
Your app will send the `public_account_token` to your backend server. Your backend server will make a request to `/link/exchange` to create the new account your user just linked.

➡️ [Implementation Guide - Exchange Public Account](/docs/api/link/implementation/exchange-public-accounts)

#### 4. Store your new account_id
The flow is now complete! You can now initiate payments to the new `account` created using link.
