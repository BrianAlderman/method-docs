# Initialize Link

**About**: Using the `link_token`, retrieved by your backend server, launch Method Link using your desired implementation / library.

## Webview

### Link Environment URLs
Link is optimized to work within Webviews, including on iOS and Android. The Link URL corresponds the environment you are building in:

```text
https://link.dev.methodfi.com (Development)
https://link.sandbox.methodfi.com (Sandbox)
https://link.production.methodfi.com (Production)
```

#### Communication between Link and your app
Communication between your app is handled using HTTP redirects. Your webview / app should intercept the redirects in order to react accordingly to state changes.

All redirect URLs will have the scheme ("prefix") `methodlink`. The event type will be the URL host and the payload will be query strings.

```text
methodlink://{event_type}
```

### Initialize Link
Open a webview in your app to your desired environment using the `link_token` you obtained for an entity.

```text
https://link.production.methodfi.com?token={link_token}
```
