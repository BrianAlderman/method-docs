# Launch Auth Element

**About**: Using the `element_token` retrieved from your backend server in the previous step, you can launch
the Auth Element using your desired implementation.

### Webview
The Auth Element is optimized to work within Webviews, including on iOS and Android. The Auth URL
corresponds the environment you are building in:

```text
https://elements.dev.methodfi.com (Development)
https://elements.sandbox.methodfi.com (Sandbox)
https://elements.production.methodfi.com (Production)
```

#### Communication between Auth and your app
Communication between your app is handled using HTTP redirects. Your webview / app should intercept the
redirects in order to react accordingly to state changes.

All redirect URLs will have the scheme ("prefix") `methodelements`. The event source will be
the URL host and the payload will be query strings.

##### General Element Events
```text
methodelements://general?{event_data}
```

##### Auth Specific Element Events
```text

#### Initialize Auth Element

```

```
