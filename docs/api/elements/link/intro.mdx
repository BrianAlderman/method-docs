# Overview of the Link Element

The Link Element allows you to securely collect account numbers or PANs ("Primary account number") from your users. This handles the tokenization, and creation of the accounts on your behalf.

The demo below exhibits the multiple use cases in which the Link Element may be used in your application.

### Link Element Flow Overview
The Link Element flow begins once your user is required to connect their `ach` or `liability` accounts.


#### 1. Create Element Token
Your backend server will make a request to `/elements/token` to generate a `element_token` for an `entity`. This `element_token` will be used to initalize the Link Element in your app.

#### 2. Launch Link Element
Using the `element_token` to launch the Link Element for your user. Once the user successfully connects their financial account, the Link Element will return a temporary `public_account_token` to exchange and create a `account`.

#### 3. Exchange Public Account
Your app will send the `public_account_token` to your backend server. Your backend server will then make a request to `/elements/accounts/exchange` to create the new account your user just linked.

#### 4. Store your new account_id
The flow is now complete! You can now initiate payments to the newly created `account`.
