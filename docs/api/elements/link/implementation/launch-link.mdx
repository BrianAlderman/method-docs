# Launch Link Element

**About**: Using the `element_token` retrieved from your backend server in the previous step, you can launch the Link Element using your desired implementation.

### Webview
The Link Element is optimized to work within Webviews, including on iOS and Android. The Link URL corresponds the environment you are building in:


```text
https://elements.dev.methodfi.com (Development)
https://elements.sandbox.methodfi.com (Sandbox)
https://elements.production.methodfi.com (Production)
```

#### Communication between Link and your app
Communication between your app is handled using HTTP redirects. Your webview / app should intercept the redirects in order to react accordingly to state changes.

All redirect URLs will have the scheme ("prefix") `methodelements`. The event source will be the URL host and the payload will be query strings.

##### General Element Events
```text
methodelements://general?{event_data}
```

##### Link Specific Element Events
```text
methodelements://link?{event_data}
```

#### Initialize Link Element
Open a webview in your app to your desired environment using the link_token you obtained for an entity


```
https://elements.production.methodfi.com?token={element_token}
```
