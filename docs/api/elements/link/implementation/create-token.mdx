# Create element token

**About**: Creates an element token to launch a Link Element session for a specific entity. Element tokens are only valid for 30 minutes after they are created, and can only be used once.


**API Method**: `POST /elements/token`

### Request

#### Example with merchant restriction
If you have already integrated with a data aggregator (Plaid) to collect your user's information. We recommend creating an `element_token` for a specific merchant and mask pair.

For example, if your user connected their AMEX credit card ending in 4127 using your own Plaid integration, you will create an `element_token` that will open the Link Element directly to a secure AMEX form where the user will confirm their account ending in 4127.

> **Tip**: Use the [merchants endpoint](../../4.%20Merchants/2-GetMerchants.md) to find the corresponding `mch_id` for the identifier used by your aggregator. (e.g Plaid's `ins_id`)

<ElementsCreateLinkToken />

#### Example without merchant restriction
If you have not integrated with a data aggregator (Plaid), you can securely collect your user's information by requesting an `element_token` without a merchant restriction. This will open the Link Element to a search screen for the user to choose which account to link.
