# The account object

Accounts are a representation of an entity's financial accounts. An account can be a checking or savings account (`ach`) or a credit card, student loan, etc. (`liability`)

* To create an `ach` account you will need the routing and account number of the depository account. We recommend using [Plaid](https://plaid.com/products/auth) to retrieve your entity's `ach` information.

* To create a `liability` account you will need the `merchant` id (`mch_id`) and the account number of the liability.

> ℹ️ **Important**: The `holder_id` is the id of the `Entity` who owns this account. Associating the incorrect `Entity` will lead to failed/returned payments.
