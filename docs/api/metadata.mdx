# Metadata

Method allows you to provide arbitrary data upon creation of any Core API resource. This data is referred to as **metadata** and will be returned as the `metadata` attribute on any Core API resource.

Adding metadata to Core API resources is useful if you want to provide additional identifiers that reference specific records or rows in your own database.

The provided metadata should be a valid JSON object, and must be less than 1KB in size when serialized.

#### Example - create an entity with metadata
